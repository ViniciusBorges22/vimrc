# vimrc
My .vimrc backup including some plugins installed and managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Also works with Neovim without aditional configuration.

## Installation prerequisites
- A Unix-like operating system
- bash
- git

## Running prerequisites
- neovim or vim 7.5+ (remove "set termguicolors" inside **.vimrc** in case you use a older version)

### Optionals
- npm (for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim))
- ccls (for C++ autocompletion)
- powerline-fonts (for the correct display of [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) symbols)

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/vhborges/vimrc.git
cd vimrc
./install.sh
```
