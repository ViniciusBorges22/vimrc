My .vimrc backup including some plugins installed and managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Also works with Neovim without aditional configuration.

- git

### Optionals
- npm (for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim))
- ccls (for C++ autocompletion)

## Installation

```
