# vimrc
My .vimrc backup including some plugins installed and managed by [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
Also works with Neovim without aditional configuration.

## Dependencies
- neovim or vim 7.5+ (remove "set termguicolors" in **.vimrc** in case you use a older version)
- git
- npm (for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim))

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/vhborges/vimrc.git
cd vimrc
./install.sh
```
During installation you will see an error regarding the one color scheme. Just ignore it, this plugin will be installed automatically.
